                    I love coding and find joy in every line I write. For me, programming isn’t just a job—it’s a passion and a way to create, explore, and solve problems. I enjoy building projects that are both functional and visually engaging, experimenting with new technologies, and constantly learning to improve my skills. As a FullStack MERN developer, I thrive on crafting dynamic web applications, designing smooth user experiences, and turning ideas into reality. Coding is more than work, it’s a craft I love to master every day.
